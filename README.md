Layer 0 – Sovereignty

Description:
Layer 0 is the central physical and digital infrastructure of the ecosystem. It consists of industrial printing stations for paper and blockchain-based documents, integrated with lightweight citizen nodes and decentralized AI for transaction validation, governance, and traceability.

Key Features:

Minimal Interface: BIOS v0.0 with “Enter/Exit,” simplifying the user experience.

Lightweight Citizen Node: Fractioned ledger, synchronized with Layer 0 and central node.

Decentralized AI: Request verification, testnet mining control, external module validation.

Testnet Mining: Configurable and pausable workload assignment for safe testing.

Modular Integration: Supports verified external code contributions through AI consensus.


Objective:
To ensure technological sovereignty, security, scalability, and traceability, integrating money printing, controlled mining, and citizen governance over the Bitcoin network.

Terms of Collaboration – Layer 0 Sovereignty

Purpose
This agreement defines the preliminary collaboration framework for professionals or entities participating in the Layer 0 project, which develops the industrial printing machine for decentralized electronic and fiat money.

1. Nature of Collaboration
Participation in this repository implies an interest in contributing to the research, design, and development of the Layer 0 infrastructure. Collaboration is voluntary, transparent, and oriented toward the creation of a decentralized, sovereign technological system.

2. Limited Professional Scope
Layer 0 seeks to collaborate with a minimal and select group of professionals. Each contributor is expected to operate with technical precision, discretion, and integrity.

3. Ownership and Benefits
Contributors retain authorship over their code, designs, or documented contributions, while granting Layer 0 the right to integrate and use them within the project.
Future financial or intellectual benefits derived from the project will be shared proportionally among recognized contributors, based on verifiable contributions logged in this repository.

4. Confidentiality
Collaborators agree to maintain confidentiality regarding technical designs, source code, and strategic documents shared within private repositories or internal communications.

5. No Immediate Financial Obligation
This collaboration does not constitute an employment or service contract. Compensation or benefits will only apply if explicitly agreed upon in future formal agreements once the Layer 0 infrastructure reaches operational or commercial deployment.

6. Acknowledgment of Vision
All collaborators acknowledge that Layer 0 aims to establish a sovereign and decentralized printing and validation infrastructure, serving as the physical base layer for secure monetary and digital documentation systems.

7. Acceptance
By contributing to this repository, collaborators confirm understanding and acceptance of these terms and agree to act in alignment with the long-term objectives of Layer 0.
