Layer 0 – Sovereignty

Description:
Layer 0 is the central physical and digital infrastructure of the ecosystem. It consists of industrial printing stations for paper and blockchain-based documents, integrated with lightweight citizen nodes and decentralized AI for transaction validation, governance, and traceability.

Key Features:

Minimal Interface: BIOS v0.0 with “Enter/Exit,” simplifying the user experience.

Lightweight Citizen Node: Fractioned ledger, synchronized with Layer 0 and central node.

Decentralized AI: Request verification, testnet mining control, external module validation.

Testnet Mining: Configurable and pausable workload assignment for safe testing.

Modular Integration: Supports verified external code contributions through AI consensus.


Objective:
To ensure technological sovereignty, security, scalability, and traceability, integrating money printing, controlled mining, and citizen governance over the Bitcoin network.
